# Contributing to Labs

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

## Before you start

* Comment on the issue that you plan to work on so we can assign it to you and there isn't unnecessary duplication of work.
* If you're fixing some smaller issue - please check the list of pending Pull Requests to avoid unnecessary duplication.

## How can you help

You can help in multiple ways: 
* Reproducing bugs, finding its root cause and providing fixes to that, this will be appreciated a lot (see the issues with label: `bug`)
* Sending Pull Requests for new experiment (see the issues with label: `new experiment`)
* Doing Code Reviews on the Pull Requests from the developers of this community and verifying if PRs are working correctly or not

## Pull Requests

All contributions are done through Pull Requests here on GitHub.

Please follow the guidelines below:-

* Submit all code changes via pull requests (PRs) rather than through a direct commit. PRs will be reviewed and potentially merged by the repo maintainers after a peer review that includes at least one maintainer.
* **DO NOT** submit "work in progress" PRs.  A PR should only be submitted when it is considered ready for review and subsequent merging by the contributor.

## Linting

We use [nblint](https://pypi.org/project/nblint/) for ensuring Labs is nice and easy to use and work on long-term.


## Coding Style Changes

Please:
* **DO NOT** send PRs for style changes. For example, do not send PRs that are focused on changing usage of ```Int32``` to ```int```.
* **DO NOT** send PRs for upgrading code to use newer language features, though it's ok to use newer language features as part of new code that's written.  For example, it's ok to use expression-bodied members as part of new code you write, but do not send a PR focused on changing existing properties or methods to use the feature.
Give priority to the current style of the project or file you're changing even if it diverges from the general guidelines.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github).
